== Description ==

Thanks to the nice guys at http://pagepeeker.com we have a new provider for the snapshots. 
This plugin is fully functional again!

It's pretty annoying when people that comment on your blog don’t have a gravatar.
Wordpress gives them a default picture, or if you have the plugin a geometric image.  
Now, I’ve got another alternative: Their blog’s screenshot!! 
All you have to do is fallow the steps in install.
